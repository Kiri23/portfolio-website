**...**  
*Have you had dreams about your code?*

This is how my professor and then-future employer opened class one day in my second semester of Computer Science. When I first started pursuing my degree, yeah, I enjoyed the assignments, tinkering around, and the feeling of accomplishment after finishing a project, but *dreaming* about programming? I just couldn't relate to what he said.

Down the road in my Software Engineering course, I helped build an Android application that provided specialized functionality for a step-tracking band - seeing the finished product piqued my interest in mobile development. This led to me applying for an intern iOS developer position at the App Factory in December of 2016. After settling in and finding my bearings in **XCode** and **Swift**, it all clicked. I understood what he was talking about. From that point on I have been absolutely engulfed by the world of software engineering and fully subscribed to iOS development.

{% section_title My Experience at the App Factory %}

{% textalign left %}
The App Factory is an interdisciplinary group located on UW-Parkside's campus. We are made up of faculty mentors and student interns who develop iOS, Android, and web applications.  
* We abide by **Agile Methodologies**, perform weekly standups, make use of **Jira** for project management, **Slack** for communication, and rotate **Scrum** roles for new projects.  
* Since we work with real clients, I've learned how to communicate ideas to technical and non-techinal people alike.  
* I've dealt with the pressure to deliver a product in time for a hard deadline.  
* Even just hanging around with other aspiring professionals, whether it's learning something new or tutoring a new recruit, has molded me into a more well-rounded developer.

I've had a blast working in this environment and it's given me the drive to never stop learning!
