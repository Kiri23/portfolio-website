The app allows users to choose teams from any year that the sports API provides. The API provides stats for the teams that year, which I used to simulate a game between the two teams.      
**Algorithm**  
* The simulation algorithm uses the teams' overall wins, division wins, strength of schedule, and total points against stats to produce a matrix of either 0, 3, 7 which represent possible scores.  
* At random intervals on the score clock, based on their opponents defensive stats they have a chance to randomly select a position in the matrix leading to a possible score. After their attempt, the ball gets turned over to the other team.

**Takeaways** 
* The symmetrical design struck me as an opportunity to use **Stack Views** 
* The team selectors demanded custom **UIPickerViews** 
* **sportradar's NFL API**: More practice calling and parsing network APIs to save to a model

A simple app that gave me freedom to work creatively and get repetition with data manipulation.
